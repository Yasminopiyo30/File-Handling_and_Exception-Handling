# File Handling & Error Handling in Python

## 📌 Overview

This project contains two Python scripts demonstrating **file reading/writing** and **error handling**:

- **`file_read_write.py`** – Reads an input file, modifies its content (converts text to uppercase), and writes it to a new output file.
- **`error_handling_lab.py`** – Prompts the user for a filename and handles errors if the file doesn’t exist or can’t be read.

These exercises are part of the **File Read & Write Challenge 🖋️** and **Error Handling Lab 🧪** assignments.
