File Handling & Error Handling in Python
📌 Overview

This project contains two Python scripts demonstrating file reading/writing and error handling:

file_read_write.py – Reads an input file, modifies its content (converts text to uppercase), and writes it to a new output file.

error_handling_lab.py – Prompts the user for a filename and handles errors if the file doesn’t exist or can’t be read.

These exercises are part of the File Read & Write Challenge 🖋️ and Error Handling Lab 🧪 assignments.

📂 Files Included

file_read_write.py – Script for file read & write challenge.

error_handling_lab.py – Script for error handling lab.

input.txt – Sample input file (you can create your own).

README.md – Instructions and project details.

🚀 How to Run
1. File Read & Write Challenge
python file_read_write.py


Make sure an input.txt file exists in the same directory.

Output will be saved as modified_output.txt.

2. Error Handling Lab
python error_handling_lab.py


Enter the filename when prompted.

If the file doesn’t exist, you’ll see an error message.

📝 Example

input.txt

Hello world!
This is a sample text file.


modified_output.txt (after running file_read_write.py)

HELLO WORLD!
THIS IS A SAMPLE TEXT FILE.

⚠️ Error Handling Examples

If you enter a non-existing file:

❌ Error: The file was not found. Please check the filename and try again.


If you don’t have read permissions:

❌ Error: You don’t have permission to read this file.

✅ Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:

Understand how to read and write files in Python.

Learn how to handle errors using try/except.

Build more robust and user-friendly Python applications.
